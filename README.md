My bachelor thesis will mostly focus on introducing differential and symplectic geometry, then showing its applications to the motion of a rigid body and/or the passage from classical to quantum mechanics.

I am looking to start properly writing at least the introductory part some time in May, and to be done by September in order to graduate in October.
